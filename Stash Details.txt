git stash can be included with function as well:
git stash save "message"

if another change made and again stashing done, than we have multiple stashes:
git stash save "new message"

How to list all the stashes:
git stash list

Now suppose we dont want a particular stash:
git stash drop <stash name>

To drop all the stashes:
git stash clear
=================================================================
Git stash is very much useful when you don't want to commit as you are not done with your work and want to resume back the next day.
So you simply stash/save your work so that you can resume that next day.
And also if you don't stash, your work will be visible to other branches as well creating a confusion and not allowing any rebase of merge in other branches.
